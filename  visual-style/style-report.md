##Style Board One
The first one has great colours but the text and textures arnt that great. text is easier to readâ€¦ kinda just a neutral layout.


##style board two
the seonc done colours dont make much sence but the style works really well and is fun. Fonts hard to read on the dark back ground. the header has a cool style.

## Style Board three
The third one is just boring and i dont like it at all. Has a cool button tho.

###Overall

I think if i use the colours of the first one and the style and layout of the second one ill have a a successful layout.
