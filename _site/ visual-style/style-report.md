##Style Board One
The first one has great colours but the text and textures arn't that great. Text is easie to readâ€¦ but it is kinda just a neutral layout.


##Style Board Two
The second boards colours don't make much sense with the website content but the style works really well and is fun. Fonts hard to read on the dark background. The header has a cool style.

## Style Board Three
The third one is just boring and I dont like it at all. Has a cool button tho.



###Overall

I think if I use the colours of the first one and the style and layout of the second one I'll have a successful layout.
