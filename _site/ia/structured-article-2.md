#Types

There are more than 260 species of Monkeys found in the world today. They are derived from early primates that have been around for millions of years.

These primates range in size from only about 4 ounces to those that weigh up to 77 pounds. It isn’t fully understood what all has occurred with evolution to allow these Monkeys to branch off in so many directions. There is plenty of information though to indicate they have been around for more than 50 million years in so degree.

The Monkey is a highly adaptable creature so they do well in a variety of environments. They are able to live in the trees or on ground depending on the specific species. They are also able to consume a wide variety of different foods. For most species fruits make up the majority of their diet. Many of them also consume insects.

Monkeys can be devided into two catagories, The old world monkeys and the new world monkeys.

## The Old World Monkeys

The Old World monkeys or **Cercopithecidae** are a group of primates, falling in the superfamily **Cercopithecoidea** in the clade (or parvorder) of Catarrhini. 

The Old World monkeys are native to Africa and Asia today, inhabiting a range of environments from tropical rain forest to savanna, shrubland and mountainous terrain, and are also known from Europe in the fossil record. However, a (possibly introduced) free-roaming group of monkeys still survives in Gibraltar (Europe) to this day. Old World monkeys include many of the most familiar species of nonhuman primates, such as baboons and macaques.

## The New World Monkeys

New World monkeys are the five families of primates that are found in Central and South America and portions of Mexico: Callitrichidae, Cebidae, Aotidae, Pitheciidae, and Atelidae. The five families are ranked together as the **Platyrrhini** parvorder and the **Ceboidea** superfamily, which are essentially synonymous since Ceboidea is the only living platyrrhine superfamily.

New World monkeys are small to mid-sized primates, ranging from the pygmy marmoset (the world's smallest monkey), at 14 to 16 cm (5.5 to 6.3 in) and a weight of 120 to 190 grams (4.2 to 6.7 oz) to the southern muriqui, at 55 to 70 cm (22 to 28 in) and a weight of 12 to 15 kg (26 to 33 lb). New World monkeys differ slightly from Old World monkeys in several aspects. The most prominent phenotype distinction is the nose, which is the feature used most commonly to distinguish between the two groups. The clade for the New World monkeys, Platyrrhini, means "flat nosed". The noses of New World monkeys are flatter than the narrow noses of the Old World monkeys, and have side-facing nostrils. New World monkeys are the only monkeys with prehensile tails—in comparison with the shorter, non-grasping tails of the anthropoids of the Old World.
