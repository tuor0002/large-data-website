				<h1>Monkey Types</h1>
				<p>	
				Types of monkeys are classified into two major groups, the New World primates (South and Central America) and the Old World primates (Asia and Africa). The major difference, besides living on different continents, is that the New World primates have tails that can grasp and hold things while the Old World primates can't do much with their tails and sometimes have no tail at all. New World primates do not have versatile opposable thumbs like many other primates and most Old World primates do.</p>

				<h2> New World Monkeys </h2>
				<p> New World monkeys are small to mid-sized primates, ranging from the pygmy marmoset (the world's smallest monkey), at 14 to 16 cm (5.5 to 6.3 in) and a weight of 120 to 190 grams (4.2 to 6.7 oz) to the southern muriqui, at 55 to 70 cm (22 to 28 in) and a weight of 12 to 15 kg (26 to 33 lb). New World monkeys differ slightly from Old World monkeys in several aspects. The most prominent phenotype distinction is the nose, which is the feature used most commonly to distinguish between the two groups. The clade for the New World monkeys, Platyrrhini, means "flat nosed". The noses of New World monkeys are flatter than the narrow noses of the Old World monkeys, and have side-facing nostrils. New World monkeys are the only monkeys with prehensile tailsâ€”in comparison with the shorter, non-grasping tails of the anthropoids of the Old World.
New World monkeys (except for the howler monkeys of genus Alouatta) also typically lack the trichromatic vision of Old World monkeys. Colour vision in New World primates relies on a single gene on the X-chromosome to produce pigments that absorb medium and long wavelength light, which contrasts with short wavelength light. As a result, males rely on a single medium/long pigment gene and are dichromatic, as are homozygous females. Heterozygous females may possess two alleles with different sensitivities within this range, and so can display trichromatic vision. New World monkeys in the family Atelidae are the only primates with tails that are prehensile. Many New World monkeys are small and almost all are arboreal, so knowledge of them is less comprehensive than that of the more easily observed Old World monkeys. Unlike most Old World monkeys, many New World monkeys form monogamous pair bonds, and show substantial paternal care of young. They eat fruits, nuts, insects, flowers, bird eggs, spiders, and small mammals. Unlike humans and most Old World monkeys, their thumbs are not opposable(except for some Cebids). </p>

					<h2> Old World Monkeys </h2>
					<p> Noses
	
	Old world monkeys feature down facing noses called catarrhine that have nostrils that are close together and that open downward, like human nostrils, or forward, like gorilla nostrils.  This is different from new world monkeys that have flat noses called platyrrhine and also feature nostrils that are far apart and open at the sides. 
	
	Hands
	
	Hands are another area where old world monkeys differ from their new world counter parts.  The hands of old world monkeys feature thumbs that are opposable and more readily capable of grasping a variety of objects.  New world monkeys have thumbs that sit along the same line as their other digits and are built more for speed in the trees than grasping.  In fact, the spider monkeys of South America have lost their thumbs altogether. 
	
	Tails
	
	While only a few New World monkeys have tails, all old world monkeys share this feature.  New world monkeys that do have tails feature a prehensile tail which is capable of grasping while old world monkeys do not have prehensile tails.  Tails on old world monkeys feature sitting pads near the base that are used to give the monkey balance and support while sitting in trees or on the ground.
	
	Habitat
	
	Although new world monkeys confine themselves to highly specialized regions such as the rainforests of Brazil, old world monkeys venture into several different climates, regions and ecological habitats.  Macaques can be found in both the forests and the towns in India while Gelada graze in the highlands of Ethiopia.  Additionally, many old world monkeys, such as the colobus, are arboreal while others, such as the baboon, are completely terrestrial and live in savannahs.
	
	Tooth Allocation
	
	Old world monkeys have 2 premolars and have a mandible premolar that is specialized for sharpening the upper canine teeth.  The molars in old world monkeys also feature sharp cusps.  These features allow the old world monkeys to incorporate meat along with tougher fruits and nuts into their diet.  New world monkeys have three premolars and large back molars designed more for fruit than meat.</p>
